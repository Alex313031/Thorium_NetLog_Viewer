# Thorium NetLog Viewer
Fork of the [Chromium NetLog Viewer](https://chromium.googlesource.com/catapult/+/master/netlog_viewer/) for [Thorium.rocks](https://thorium.rocks/).

This app loads [NetLog .json files](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-stack/netlog) generated by Thorium's `chrome://net-export`. Log data is processed and visualized entirely on the client side (your browser). Data is never uploaded
to a remote endpoint.

The latest version of the Thorium Net Log Viewer can be accessed at: [netlog.html](https://thorium.rocks/misc/thorium_netlog_viewer/netlog.html)

The latest version of the Chromium Net Log Viewer can be accessed at: [https://netlog-viewer.appspot.com/](https://netlog-viewer.appspot.com/)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium_NetLog_Viewer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to modify and run locally, or report bugs.
